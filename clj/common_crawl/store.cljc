;; etzhayyim-project-common-crawl — injectable substrate store seam (ADR-2606280030).
;;
;; The legacy Python pipeline talked to RisingWave/psycopg2 directly (phase3g/3i,
;; phase4, phase5's --from-rw loader) and to a "graph adapter" HTTP endpoint
;; (phase5b). RisingWave/Postgres are FORBIDDEN as canonical state by the repo
;; substrate boundary (root CLAUDE.md: state = kotoba Datom log, no RisingWave).
;;
;; This ns defines a thin `Store` protocol so the ported namespaces never name a
;; backend: a kotoba-Datom-log store, an HTTP graph-adapter store, or an in-memory
;; store (tests) all satisfy it. Bulk SQL ingest (the 985M-row tables) is NOT
;; reimplemented here — those modules keep their .py and are marked partial.
